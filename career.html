  <p>Career Option 1: Lawyer</p>
      <p>In the future, I would like to embark a journey on the career path of a lawyer because political science has always been an interest of mine. Political science is the study of the principles and structure within the government and political institutions. Thus, the career of a lawyer has always interested me because I want to advocate for political justice within the legal system. Lawyers often earn competitive salaries, especially those with experience and expertise in high-demand areas of law. Partners at law firms, successful solo practitioners, and lawyers in certain specialized fields can achieve significant financial success. The legal landscape is dynamic and subject to change. Lawyers must stay informed about evolving laws and legal precedents. This commitment to continuous learning can be intellectually stimulating and may appeal to individuals who enjoy staying updated on legal developments.</p>

  <p>Career Option 2: Journalist</p>
      <p>In the future, I would also like to embark a journey on the career path of a journalist because using writing to connect with others and shed light on the many conflicts of this world has been a passion of mine. Journalism is the gathering, writing, and editing of materials for news sources such as television and newspaper. Journalism has been an interest of a possible career option as I want to inform people who may be unaware of the global conflics of the world. Journalists often have the opportunity to express their ideas and opinions, contributing to the principles of free speech and freedom of the press. They can investigate and report on matters of public interest without undue censorship. Journalists have the power to raise awareness about social issues, injustices, and other matters that may not receive sufficient attention. Through their reporting, they can shed light on topics that impact communities and individuals. </p>

  <p>Career Option 3: Pediatrician</p>
      <p>In the future, the career path of a pediatrcian has been an interest of mine. I enjoy working with children and my experience as a older sister contributes to the care that I have for those younger than me. Despite giving medicine to children that are sick, pediatricians form strong bonds with their young patients, becoming a postive relationship.Pediatricians focus not only on treating illnesses but also on preventive care. They play a crucial role in promoting healthy lifestyles, vaccination, and early intervention to prevent health issues in children, setting a foundation for a lifetime of well-being.</p>
