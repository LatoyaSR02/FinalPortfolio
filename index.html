        <p>Introduction to Class</p>
        <p>Programming and Prototyping puts a focus on Python and covers the fundamental concepts of programming using
          Python as the primary language. This class emphasizes on the practical aspects of prototyping, which involves
          creating versions of software to test ideas and concepts. The skills that I have learned so far in this class
          are python syntax, graphics, variables, data types, and algorithms. In addition, I learned how to utilize
          functions and conditionals using if else statements. Fundamental skills such as debugging and modifying helped
          me be more comfortable using Python and refining my knowledge of Python</p>
