    <p> I created a personalized avatar reflecting my physical features using Python in Replit.The inspiration behind the project was to explore the intersection of coding and self-expression, turning lines of code into a digital representation of myself.Striking a balance between accuracy and stylization presented a challenge. Conveying nuanced features through code required thoughtful consideration of details.The process of translating real-world attributes into a digital form was both enjoyable and introspective. It allowed for a unique form of self-expression.The precision achievable through coding to represent facial features was surprising. It highlighted the potential of code as a creative toolI am proud of successfully capturing my likeness through code, turning a conceptual idea into a tangible, visual representation.</p></div>

    <p>Developed subroutines for basic arithmetic operations and created a program incorporating user input to perform these operations. Motivated by the need to understand and implement functions/subroutines for modular code. Managing user input, function calls, and organizing the code for clarity. What did you enjoy the most? Seeing how functions enhance code modularity and reusability. The efficiency gained through the use of functions in handling repetitive tasks. Successfully implementing a program that leverages functions for different arithmetic operations. Beginners exploring functions and modular code in Python. Comments explaining the purpose of each function and how they contribute to the overall program.</p></div>

    <p> In this lab we had four subroutines - add, subtract, multiply, divide that add multiply etc two numbers and return the result. Each should have two integer number arguments. The user is asked to input two numbers. These numbers will be passed as arguments into one of the subroutines.I created a Python program that repeatedly asks the user for their username and password until they enter the correct password. Inspired by the need for secure and iterative user authentication. Balancing the loop condition and ensuring secure password handling. Implementing a secure login system with a clear iterative structure. What surprised you? The simplicity and power of using loops for repetitive tasks like user authentication. Creating a secure login system that provides users with multiple attempts to enter the correct password. Individuals learning about secure login systems and iteration in Python. Clear comments explaining the security measures implemented and the purpose of each code segment.</p></div>

    <p> In this lab we used python to create colored dots. We used this by using python functions for shapes specificially circles. I utilized Python to generate colorful dots.  Exploration of Python's capabilities in graphics and color manipulation. Achieving the desired visual aesthetics and understanding color representation in Python. Experimenting with color combinations and creating visually appealing patterns. The versatility of Python in generating graphical elements. Creating an aesthetically pleasing pattern using Python graphics. Individuals exploring Python graphics and color manipulation. Detailed comments explaining the color representation and graphical techniques used</p></div>
